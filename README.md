<> Link color #5785a8
<> possible colour gradients #A6206A (purple) #EC1C4B(redish), #F16A43 (orange), #F7D969 (pale yellow), #2F9395 (tealish), 80s retrowave color palette.

## Struggling to make aside side nav bar
linear gradient and text shadow were surprisingly simple but very cool.

I think css grid would have been a tad easier to work with if I knew it just as much as flexbox.
 
 Started using grid for gallery, not insanely hard for a simple setup but I haven't been using *span* at all.
